# U.S-Health-Insurance-Regression-Analysis
For this project, we aimed to explore the effects of certain features such as smoking habits, age, and others have on predicting health insurance for patients in the U.S. Throughout the project we explored the effects of interaction, polynomial terms on regression techniques as well as model selection and improvement methods such as Box-Cox transformations. Various models were compared using metrics such as RMSE and adjusted R-squared and used to predict the health insurance cost for an individual.
